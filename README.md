# MIPS-Projects
A collection of programs and procedures in MIPS assembly.

## isPrime
A small procedure, with wrapping program, written in MIPS assembly to determine whether a given number is a prime. Uses the algorithm given on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test because I needed something simple and easy to implement.
